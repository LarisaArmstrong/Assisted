EPIC: Fortune Cookie Operator
-----------------------------

User Registration:
1. As a user I want to be able to receive a simple fortune easily.
  - Design a proceed button
  - Mockup and code a return flow
  - Create a return of a random fortune based on the data selected by users

2. As a user I want to be entertained by this logic for overall good user experience
  - Design good input such as a picture of a fortune cookie and user clicking the picture to ‘crack open the fortune cookie’ for a return.

3. As a user I want to be able to receive more than one fortune if unsatisfied with return
  - Allow user to ‘crack’ open different fortune multiple times
